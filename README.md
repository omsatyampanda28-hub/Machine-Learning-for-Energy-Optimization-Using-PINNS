# Machine-Learning-for-Energy-Optimization-Using-PINNS
we explored Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate physical laws into neural networks, enhancing model generalization and interpretability.This paper explores machine learning (ML) techniques for energy consumption optimization in commercial buildings based on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset.
